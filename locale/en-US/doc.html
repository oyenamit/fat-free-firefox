            <h2>Search Behavior in Location Bar</h2><hr>
            In Firefox 43, the location bar was enhanced with extra search related capabilities. When users type something in the location bar, related search suggestions are provided at the end of the dropdown list.  Also, Firefox adds a <i>"Visit www.example.com"</i> or <i>"Search with Google" </i> entry at the top of the dropdown list. Users may find these new <i>features</i> annoying and distracting and might want to disable them completely.
            <br><br>
            Note that for Firefox 42 and below, these features were deactivated by Firefox (this option in the Fat-Free Fox preferences would be selected by default).
            <h2>Push Notifications by Websites</h2><hr>
            In Firefox 44, a new feature called <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/push-notifications-firefox">Web Push notifications</a> was introduced which allows a website to display notifications to the users even when the site is no longer open. For example, an email provider could display a notification to inform users that a new email has been received. Or, an online retailer could show a notification when an item in user's wish list is about to go out of stock. The system uses servers maintained by Mozilla (Desktop) or Google (Android) using which a site can push notifications to the user's screen even when the site is not open. A basic version of this feature can be seen in action by visiting <a href="https://goroost.com/try-web-push">goroost.com</a>.
            <br><br>
            Firefox provides options to the users to allow/block these push notifications on a per-site basis. Users can also block notifications temporarily from all sites for the current session of Firefox; when Firefox is restarted, the notifications will be enabled again. However, several users might prefer a quieter browser and might like to disable all such notifications from all websites even after Firefox is restarted.
            <br><br>
            Note that for Firefox 43 and below, push notifications were deactivated by Firefox (this option in the Fat-Free Fox preferences would be selected by default).
            <h2>Tracking Protection for non-private Windows</h2><hr>
            Most of the websites and online services that are perceived as free by the users are not free in the true sense. In exchange for free web content, these sites allow third-party advertisers to harvest users' private data like location, email addresses, areas of interests, likes and dislikes, browsing habits etc. The advertisers use this data to uniquely identify visitors, build a profile and follow them when they surf across the web through multiple websites. These browsing profiles can be very specific and shockingly revealing - mothers with infant children or a person with affiliation to the Democratic Party. This <a href="http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/entertainment-media/outlook/segment-insights/internet-advertising.html">multi-billion dollar digital marketing industry</a> has caused seemingly mundane activities like shopping, chatting and travelling to be constantly recorded, analyzed and monetized.
            <br><br>
            As long as the user is a willing participant, this sort of tracking can be a good thing. For example, online retailers can tailor their websites to their needs and ensure they are more likely to see advertisements for products and services relevant to their interests; restaurant discovery sites can offer its users an individualized experience based on their location and past preferences. The problem is that most of this information has been secretly harvested without making it clear to the users what is being collected and how that information is being used. A recent <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/06/the-online-privacy-lie-is-unraveling/">report</a> into the US consumers' attitude to this collection of personal data has revealed that most users feel powerless against the ubiquitous "big brother" like advertising networks who are always watching over their shoulders.
            <br><br>
            Firefox <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2015/11/03/firefox-now-offers-a-more-private-browsing-experience/">introduced a tracking protection</a> feature in version 42 where it would block third-party content like ads, analytics trackers and social share buttons that may record users' behavior without their knowledge. This built-in tracking protection is similar in nature to the one provided by popular extensions like <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adblock-plus/">Adblock Plus</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/">uBlock Origin</a>. However, by default, Firefox enables this feature only for <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/tracking-protection-pbm">Private Browsing windows</a>. Many privacy-conscious users might wish to benefit from this protection in non-private windows too. Users can also select between <i>Basic</i> and <i>Strict</i> protection in Firefox preferences.
            <br><br>
            <b>CAUTION</b>: With tracking protection enabled, some web pages may appear broken since ads that track behavior are blocked. Users can disable tracking protection on a per-site basis using the <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/control-center-site-privacy-and-security-firefox">Control Center</a> built into Firefox.
            <h2>WebRTC Private IP Address Leak</h2><hr>
            WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communications) is a technology that enables audio/video streaming and data sharing between two browsers without the need for any plugins. Firefox Hello is one such feature built into Firefox that makes use of WebRTC. Real-Time applications like video calls work best when connection is made directly between the two browsers, producing the lowest latency and the best user experience. In order to establish such direct connections, WebRTC collects every IP address that might be used to reach the browser and exposes it to the outside world.
            <br><br>
            Many users take online privacy and anonymity very seriously and go to great lengths in order to protect their private information like location, IP address etc. Proxies, VPNs and Tor are some of the most common methods used to fight back against browser fingerprinting and mass surveillance. However, it turns out that WebRTC is one of the weak links in their defenses because it exposes users' public and private IP addresses to websites that they visit (even when WebRTC is <i>not</i> being actively used). Even if a user is not behind a proxy or VPN, he still might find it icky to have a <i>private</i> thing exposed to all websites.
            <br><br>
            Note that enabling this option will only block private IP address leak due to WebRTC. It will not disable WebRTC completely. Firefox Hello would still be usable as before.
            <h2>Beacon Data</h2><hr>
            When a user is about to leave a website (by closing the current tab or by navigating to another website), the webpage can send some arbitrary <i>beacon</i> data to the website server. This data is generally used for analytics and diagnostics by the website. Since the user has no control over what information is sent as part of this data, it is open to abuse by website developers and can be used to track and gather information about the users.
            <h2>Proactive Download of Webpage Content</h2><hr>
            When a user visits a webpage, the creator of the page can anticipate what links the user will click on next. Based on this anticipation, the webpage can provide a list of web content (html pages, images etc.) to Firefox so that it can be downloaded in the background even before the user clicks those links. When Firefox is idle, it will <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Link_prefetching_FAQ">silently download</a> such content and store it in its cache. If the user actually clicks on those links, they can be loaded quickly from the cache. This technique can be useful in speeding up webpage load times - for example, if the next page has several large images.
            <br><br>
            However, this look-ahead mechanism can also lead to privacy and security issues because Firefox could download webpages, images and cookies without the knowledge of the user, from sites that the user might never visit. If the user has volume based Internet data plans, he might end up paying for downloads that he neither asked for nor used. It is possible for a rogue website to abuse this feature and silently download malware onto the user's system (drive-by downloads). Also, users may unknowingly violate Internet policies of their organization if such proactive downloads access unauthorized content.
            <h2>Proactive DNS Lookups</h2><hr>
            When a user loads a website, Firefox contacts a <i>Domain Name Server</i> (DNS) to map the website's name (say, www.example.com) to its IP address (say, 93.184.216.119). This is called a <i>DNS lookup</i> or <i>resolution</i>. Using this IP address, Firefox establishes a network connection to the website and loads its pages.
            <br><br>
            In order to make page load time appear faster, Firefox uses a proactive DNS lookup mechanism. While the user is currently browsing a webpage and that webpage has links pointing to another website (say, www.google.com), Firefox speculates that the user will click on one of those links and performs DNS lookup for <i>all of them</i> in advance. While the practical benefits of such speculative performance improvements might be <a href="http://bitsup.blogspot.in/2008/11/dns-prefetching-for-firefox.html">miniscule</a>, experts agree that such practices could lead to privacy loopholes that are <a href="https://www.usenix.org/event/leet10/tech/full_papers/Krishnan.pdf">ripe for abuse</a> (PDF).
            <h2>Speculative Network Connections</h2><hr>
            In certain scenarios, Firefox uses <i>speculative connection</i> mechanism to improve loading time of web sites. For example, when a user hovers the mouse over thumbnails in the <i>New tab</i> page, Firefox opens a network connection to the website server to <i>prepare</i> so that if the user actually clicks the link, the overall speed of loading the web page is faster. Another scenario where Firefox does the same is when the user starts to search in the <i>Search Bar</i>, or in the search field on the <i>Home</i> or the <i>New Tab</i> Page. This predictive connection sends only the <i>IP address</i> of the user to the website server. No request is sent to load the page. No other user-specific data (email address, password etc.) is sent. 
            <br><br>
            It has been <a href="http://news.slashdot.org/story/15/08/14/2321202/how-to-quash-firefoxs-silent-requests">reported</a> (and also independently confirmed by the author of this add-on) that in reality speculative connections are not limited to the few scenarios mentioned above. When a user hovers mouse over <b>any</b> normal link of a website, Firefox seems to open speculative connections for those links as well. <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-stop-firefox-making-automatic-connections#w_speculative-pre-connections">Mozilla documentation</a> for this feature does not mention anything about normal links also being used for speculative connections. Moreover, Mozilla has not provided any concrete data that quantifies how much performance improvement is actually observed with predictive connections. <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=790882#c34">These</a> <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=790882#c36">comments</a> <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=790882#c37">indicate</a> that such comparative tests were never carried out.
            <br><br>
            While many users may be comfortable with their IP address being shared with web sites they never intend to visit, a number of users have <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=814169#c31">voiced</a> their <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=814169#c22">concern</a> that this is a violation of their privacy. Normally, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=814169#c20">users hover their mouse over a link</a> to know where the link actually points to and then decide whether it would be safe to click on the link or not. With speculative connections enabled, Firefox silently communicates with the web site server and shares the users' IP address. This behavior can potentially allow email spammers to <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=814169#c18">track</a> their victims, confirm that their email addresses are <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=814169#c32">active</a> and send them even more spam. Many users feel that such privacy violations are a huge price to pay for non-quantifiable and speculative performance improvements.
            <h2>Pocket&trade; for Firefox</h2><hr>
            <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/save-web-pages-later-pocket-firefox">Pocket for Firefox</a> is a feature that allows users to save web pages with just a click and read them later. While several users find this feature useful, others feel that it is an unwanted and unnecessary addition to Firefox due to the following reasons.    
            <h4>Privacy Implications</h4>
            Pocket is a <a href="https://getpocket.com/">proprietary, third-party service</a> integrated into Firefox. When users sign in to Pocket, their email address is implicitly shared with the Pocket company. When users save web pages for later use, their likes and areas of interest are stored in the servers of the Pocket company. It is quite plausible that this personal information and browsing habits are sold or transferred by Pocket to another company in future. Many users may not fully understand where their personal data is going because they implicitly trust Mozilla and the Pocket feature is bundled with the browser. When Mozilla released Pocket, they failed to inform and educate the users that Pocket is not a Mozilla service but is owned by a third-party whose <a href="https://getpocket.com/privacy">privacy policy</a> is different from <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/">Mozilla's</a>. This is a significant departure from Mozilla's commitment to <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">openness and transparency</a>. Many privacy-sensitive users feel that quietly adding a proprietary service to an open source software like Firefox is against the spirit of a free, open and neutral web.       
            <h4>UI Clutter</h4>
            Firefox UI is <i>lazy loaded</i> which means that the new Pocket feature has no impact on resource or memory usage until it is actually used. Despite that, several users are simply annoyed by the extra UI clutter because they suddenly noticed this extra <i>thing</i> in their toolbar and Bookmarks menu. They feel that it would be more appropriate if the Pocket feature is available as an optional add-on instead of being directly integrated with the browser.
            <h2>Firefox Hello</h2><hr>
            <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/hello/">Firefox Hello</a> is a communication system built into Firefox that allows video conversations between users. Many users find this feature useful but several others feel that a video calling service like Hello is not an essential component of browsing experience and might want to get rid of the extra UI clutter.
            <h2>Reader View</h2><hr>
            The <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-reader-view-clutter-free-web-pages">Reader View</a> feature improves readability of web pages by removing clutter like buttons, ads, background images etc. In case a user does not find it useful, the feature can be disabled which will remove its icon from the address bar.
