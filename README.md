# Fat-Free Fox Extension
*Safeguard your private information by disabling privacy-violating features of Firefox and by enabling tracking protection from third-party ads. Keep your browser fat-free by disabling some of its unwanted features.*

**Note 1: The name of this extension has been changed from 'Fat-Free Firefox' to 'Fat-Free Fox'. This was done to conform to Mozilla's add-on naming policies.**

**Note 2: Fat-Free Fox is compatible with [multi-process Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Multiprocess_Firefox) (Electrolysis).**

This extension offers Firefox users more control, protection and awareness about their browsing experience. It tries to strike a balance between strengthening the browser while keeping it usable at the same time.

The extension provides an easy, single-click way to disable the following features of Firefox since they can potentially be used to violate users' privacy:  
1. WebRTC Private IP Address Leak  
2. Beacon Data  
3. Proactive Download of Webpage Content  
4. Proactive DNS Lookups  
5. Speculative Network Connections  
  

In addition, users can choose to enable **Tracking Protection** for non-private browsing windows to prevent online advertising companies from secretly gathering their private data like location, gender, age, political leanings, medical conditions, areas of interest etc. Please note that when *Tracking Protection* is enabled, some web pages may appear broken since ads that track behavior are blocked. Users can disable tracking protection on a per-site basis using the [Control Center](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/control-center-site-privacy-and-security-firefox) built into Firefox.

The extension can also be used to disable features that users may find unnecessary or just plain annoying:  
1. The "Visit example.com" and "Search with Google" entries in location bar (introduced in Firefox 43)  
2. Push Notifications by websites (introduced in Firefox 44)  
3. Pocket  
4. Firefox Hello  
5. Reader View

## Installation
You can install the extension by building it from source or by downloading it from the [Mozilla Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fat-free-firefox/) site.

## Usage
To alter a feature, open *Preferences* (Options) for this extension in the *Firefox Add-ons Manager*. You might need to restart Firefox to make the changes fully effective. This *Preferences* page also contains a clickable button which displays detailed information about each of the supported features.
