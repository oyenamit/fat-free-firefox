            <h2>Speculative Connections</h2><hr>
            In certain scenarios, Firefox uses <i>speculative connection</i> mechanism to improve loading time of web sites. For example, when a user hovers the mouse over thumbnails in the <i>New tab</i> page, Firefox opens a network connection to the website server to <i>prepare</i> so that if the user actually clicks the link the overall speed of loading the web page is faster. Other scenarios where Firefox does the same is when the user starts to search in the <i>Search Bar</i>, or in the search field on the <i>Home</i> or the <i>New Tab</i> Page. This predictive connection sends only the <i>IP address</i> of the user to the website server. No request is sent to load the page. No other user-specific data (email address, password etc.) is sent. 
            <br><br>
            It has been <a href="http://news.slashdot.org/story/15/08/14/2321202/how-to-quash-firefoxs-silent-requests">reported</a> (and also independently confirmed by the author of this add-on) that in reality speculative connections are not limited to the few scenarios mentioned above. When a user hovers mouse over <b>any</b> normal link of a website, Firefox seems to open speculative connections for those links as well. <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-stop-firefox-making-automatic-connections#w_speculative-pre-connections">Mozilla documentation</a> for this feature does not mention anything about normal links also being used for speculative connections. Moreover, Mozilla has not provided any concrete data that quantifies how much performance improvement is actually observed with predictive connections. <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=790882#c34">These</a> <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=790882#c36">comments</a> <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=790882#c37">indicate</a> that such comparative tests were never carried out.
            <br><br>
            While many users may be comfortable with their IP address being shared with web sites they never intend to visit, a number of users have <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=814169#c31">voiced</a> their <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=814169#c22">concern</a> that this is a violation of their privacy. Normally, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=814169#c20">users hover their mouse over a link</a> to know where the link actually points to and then decide whether it would be safe to click on the link or not. With speculative connections enabled, Firefox silently communicates with the web site server and shares the users' IP address. This behavior can potentially allow email spammers to <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=814169#c18">track</a> their victims, confirm that their email addresses are <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=814169#c32">active</a> and send them even more spam. Many users feel that such privacy violations are a huge price to pay for non-quantifiable and speculative performance improvements.
            <h2>Pocket&trade; for Firefox</h2><hr>
            <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/save-web-pages-later-pocket-firefox">Pocket for Firefox</a> is a feature that allows users to save web pages with just a click and read them later. While several users find this feature useful, others feel that it is an unwanted and unnecessary addition to Firefox due to the following reasons.    
            <h4>Privacy Implications</h4>
            Pocket is a <a href="https://getpocket.com/">proprietary, third-party service</a> integrated into Firefox. When users sign in to Pocket, their email address is implicitly shared with the Pocket company. When users save web pages for later use, their likes and areas of interest are stored in the servers of the Pocket company. It is quite plausible that this personal information and browsing habits are sold/transferred by Pocket to another company in future. Many users may not fully understand where their personal data is going because they implicitly trust Mozilla and the Pocket feature is bundled with the browser. When Mozilla released Pocket, they failed to inform and educate the users that Pocket is not a Mozilla service but is owned by a third-party whose <a href="https://getpocket.com/privacy">privacy policy</a> is different from <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/">Mozilla's</a>. This is a significant departure from Mozilla's commitment to <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">openness and transparency</a>. Many privacy-sensitive users feel that quietly adding a proprietary service to an open source software like Firefox is against the spirit of a free, open and neutral web.       
            <h4>UI Clutter</h4>
            Firefox UI is <i>lazy loaded</i> which means that the new Pocket feature has no impact on resource or memory usage until it is actually used. Despite that, several users are simply annoyed by the extra UI clutter because they suddenly noticed this extra <i>thing</i> in their toolbar and Bookmarks menu. They feel that it would be more appropriate if the Pocket feature is available as an optional add-on instead of being directly integrated with the browser.
            <h2>Firefox Hello</h2><hr>
            <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/hello/">Firefox Hello</a> is a communication system built into Firefox that allows video conversations between users. Many users find this feature useful but several others feel that a video calling service like Hello is not an essential component of browsing experience and might want to get rid of the extra UI clutter.
            <h2>Reader View</h2><hr>
            The <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-reader-view-clutter-free-web-pages">Reader View</a> feature improves readability of web pages by removing clutter like buttons, ads, background images etc. In case a user does not find it useful, the feature can be disabled which will remove its icon from the address bar.
